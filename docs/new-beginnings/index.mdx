It feels a bit bad to be a web developer this days. Every framework, library, a bit suxx, if you go to see the details.
- Node.js
- npm/yarn
- versioning
- TDD general
- Selenium
- Test environments
- Backend API
- JSX

## We can solve the problems instead of doing workaround.

My plan to build:

1. To be able to develop, a chrome browser with the default settings should be enough.
2. No build time / startup time
3. Each keystroke should modify the page - and the result should be visible for the developer right away.
4. No versioning. There is one version - the live version, which deployed trough the development center
5. No environments. There is just one environment, the prod environment. Different user groups can access different keys for the APIs, 
6. SHA256 based components, that communicate with eachouthers trough messages (gRPC proto3). A component react for each message - potentieally with messages for other components.
7. If 2 components with all the possible messages reacts with the same message, we can say that the two component is equlalent
8. Cluster of components is a collection of compoenents - they are equlalent, if the messages which crossed their boundaries the same (ls 7)
9. There should be a client library loaded to the browser which communicates with the DOM.
10. DOM - events, and any data validated with hash trees after every sent message,]
