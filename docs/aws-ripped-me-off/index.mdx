It was a sunny day in August, when I got a notification on my phone, that paid $800 for aws.
Was kind of surprising, because I set the alerts and budget to $20/month.

I logged in to aws console, and seen, that I got charged for ACM certificate managert, which got triggered some aws amplify script, or I don't have any idea what.

I wrote to the customer service, and explained the sitution, they assuered me that won't happen again - but - sorry, we refund you just $400.

Next month got charged $800 again, and a month later $400 again. Yay!

## AWS is a big mess, and even their own experts has no idea what will charge's will have the customer next month.

Endless tips, todos, messages, 50% refunds, and more and more surplises - even I migrated away all of my services - still having surprises - last month magically appeared a dictionary service in the billing, which was costing me $1.33/day. 
This time I didn't bother more to write for the "experts", I just close my account.

I am looking forward for the future charges.
