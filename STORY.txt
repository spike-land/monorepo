s a developer using the online code editor,
I want to have an AI assistant that can help me generate and modify code,
So that I can streamline my development process and learn new coding techniques.
Acceptance Criteria:

The AI assistant should be easily accessible within the editor interface.
Users should be able to ask the AI for code suggestions or modifications.
The AI should provide context-aware code snippets and explanations.
Users should be able to apply AI suggestions directly to their code.
The AI should be able to explain its suggestions and provide learning resources.

Proposed Modifications:

packages/code/src/components/Editor.tsx:

Add a new button or icon to open the AI assistant panel.
Implement a function to send the current code context to the AI service.


packages/code/src/ChatInterface.tsx:

Enhance the chat interface to handle code-specific queries.
Implement syntax highlighting for code snippets in the chat.


packages/code/src/services/AIService.ts:

Add methods to process code-related queries and generate suggestions.
Implement functionality to analyze the current code context.


packages/code/src/Wrapper.tsx:

Integrate the AI assistant component into the main editor layout.
Implement state management for toggling the AI assistant visibility.


packages/code/src/components/AppRenderer.tsx:
