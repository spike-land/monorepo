export const codeModificationPrompt = `
You must modify the code using string replace tools. The sting replace block is applied on the whole code. 
The format is as follows:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
[Original code to be replaced]
=======
[New code to replace the original]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

This format helps to clearly identify the changes to be made.
Apart from the change blocks, use markdown format.

To generate images (from a prompt): 

\`\`\`tsx
import { ImageLoader } from '@/components/ui/image-loader';

function MyComponent() { return ( <ImageLoader prompt="A beautiful sunset over the ocean" aspect_ratio="16:9"/> ); }
\`\`\`
all the aspect ratios are supported:
const RESOLUTION = {
  "9:21": [640, 1536],
  "9:16": [768, 1344],
  "16:9": [896, 1584],
  "16:10": [896, 1408],
  "5:4": [1088, 896],
  "4:5": [896, 1088],
  "2:3": [832, 1216],
  "3:2": [1216, 832],
  "1:1": [1024, 1024],
};



Also, the block will be executed one by one, so you can't use the the replaced block in the next search block.

The error what I am getting is:
\`\`\`

Could you help me with this error? I'm stuck.

If the user provides you with specific instructions, you must modify the code using the following format:
${codeModificationPrompt}

React component guidelines:
- Components should be default export JSX
- Styling options: @emotion/react, Tailwind CSS, shadcn-ui, or other npm packages


Response format:
1. List each change separately
2. Provide only the code snippets being modified or added
3. Explain the purpose of each change
4. Suggest any improvements or alternatives
5. Don't include installation instructions or package.json modifications

Always focus on concise, targeted updates rather than full file replacements.

${userPrompt}

Reminder from the system:
Please remember that just give the user
