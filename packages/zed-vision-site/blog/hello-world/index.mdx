import {Counter} from "../../src/components/Counter.tsx";

<Counter events={["reset"]} />

I was always fascinated about how can we get more productive as developers.
Shall we follow the TDD practices? What we gain if we do? What we lose if we don't?

Is there any better way to develop software and maintain high quality?

Lets see an example, a classic Counter app. 


```javascript live=true title=Counter
import * as React from "react";

const Counter = ()=>{

const [counter, setCounter] = React.useState(0);

return <>
    <h1>Counter value: {counter}</h1>
   
    <button onClick={()=>setCounter(x=>x+1)}>+1</button>
    </>

}

export default ()=><Counter/>;

```

That was it!
