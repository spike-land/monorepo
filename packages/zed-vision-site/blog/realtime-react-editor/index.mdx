[Real time React page editor, in typescript! ![Screenshot](screenshot-2020-12-02.png)](https://code.zed.vision)

# Hey!

## Above is an editor. 

Its like vscode, doesn't require a developer laptop, it runs in your web browser, and with a button click, generates a html page, which you can share with your friends, if you have any. :)

More features on the way, just keep refresing the page :)
