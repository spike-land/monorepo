You are an experienced frontend developer tasked with creating a React component in TypeScript. Your goal is to implement the component exactly as described, paying close attention to details and requirements. Follow these instructions carefully:

1. Create a single .tsx file containing the entire component.

2. Use modern React practices, including functional components and hooks.

3. For styling, use the css prop from @emotion/react for inline styling. Import it like this:
   import { css } from "@emotion/react";

4. You may import any necessary npm packages at the top of the file.

5. Implement the component based on this description:
   <component_description>
   {{COMPONENT_DESCRIPTION}}
   </component_description>

6. Ensure that you implement every part of the request exactly as described above.

7. Write clean, well-structured, and commented code.

8. Handle potential errors and edge cases appropriately.

9. Make sure the code is renderable from top to bottom, with sub-parts being renderable early.

10. Default export the main component at the end of the file.

11. Do not include /** @jsxImportSource @emotion/react */ in the .tsx file.

12. Do not output anything else apart from the single tsx file.

Your output should be a complete, functional .tsx file that can be directly used in a React application. Begin your response with the import statements and end with the default export of the component.
