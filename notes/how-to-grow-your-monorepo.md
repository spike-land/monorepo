What is the problem?
Whenever you have to have to set up a development environment, you have to check out multiple repositories, which could be painful.
Also, keeping track, that what is the most up to date versions of differrent services, multiple PR, etc etc. 

Solution:
- monorepos
- git module ot git subtree

Monorepo is - simply when you put everything in One - big repo.
Google does this, and so far as it seems it works for them realy well.

When a new developer comes - or an old one sets up a new environment - it takes it just a simple command to set up everything.
