# The Monorepo

If you are like me - and you switch OS-es many time - this could be a really handy tip.

## What is the problem?

Whenever you have to have to set up a development environment, you have to check out multiple repositories, which could be painful. It just creates unnecessary friction to properly set up your development environment.

Also, keeping track, that what is the most up to date versions of different services, multiple PR, etc etc. 

Solution:
- monorepos
- git module ot git subtree

Monorepo is - simply when you put everything in One - big repo. 
It can contain anything - multiple projects.

Google does this, and so far as it seems it works for them really well.

When a new developer comes - or an old one sets up a new environment - it takes it just a simple command to set up everything.
