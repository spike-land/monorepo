When we speak, we compose from letters words, from words sentences, from senteces paragraph, from paragraph we describe the context, and we tell stories.

In development, we create components. 
We can call them functions, services, classes, libraries, frameworks, then from those ones we create applications - by composing them into features - and they sometimes contibute for the company success, that pays you to build the new thing what they want.


The problem - that is extremly hard, to write a code - which will be easily understandable by other developers. 
Why? Because of abstract ideas, and when we develop a featute, ususally the job is done.

But when a new developer comes, who doesnt understand the domain - or by time we gain more understanding, instead of rewriting the application from the bottom up - we tend to extend and modify the existing codebase.


And there will be a misallingnment with the application, and it's implementation. The app makes sense, but the implementation doesn't.
